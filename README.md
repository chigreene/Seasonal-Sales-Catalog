# Seasonal Catalog

## Description

Seasonal sales catalog is a website that gives viewers the ability to view products based off what season the product is typically used for. The webpage requires users to sign up and log in so their reviews can be stored under their user name. After a period of time the user session will expire requiring them to re-login. The opening page presents the user with a carousel with each season in one cell and each cell contains all the products of each season. By clicking on the picture of the product the user is able to view the reviews for that specific product. By clicking the "add review" button they are able to leave a review for that product. There is also a specific page for each season that has all the products in a larger view and provides details for each product. While on this page the user is able to update or delete reviews that they left on the webpage. Finally the website offers the user the ability to view all their reviews in "view profile" page. This page also allows the user to update or delete specific reviews that they left.

- Our motivation for creating this website was to create a catalog that has products sorted by season and allows the user to add and read reviews from other people.

- We built this webpage because we wanted an interactive browsing experience for a user that implements the new tech and skills we have learned.

- This web page solves the problem of needing to search for products based on the season. It also allows users to give and view feedback on the products by leaving reviews for each product.

- What we learned is how to build a backend express server and use express handlebars to dynamically rendering front end content to the webpage. We also learned how to uses sessions to store cookies and other important information like log in status and which user is logged in. We learned how to use Sequelize to set up a MySQL database to store our products, reviews, and users. Finally we used a .env file to keep important information like session keys and data-base access information private and not available to the user.
